        <div class="article" align="justify">
          <p>If you are feeling bored or looking for self-improvement, one of
            the best thing you can do for yourself is to pick up a new language.</p>
          <p>Learning a foreign language allows to experience other cultures
            more intimately when you are travelling or advance your career
            significantly. But more importantly, physiological studies have
            shown that speaking two or more languages improves the cognitive
            process of our brain. Although many of these attributes may only be
            apparent in people who speak these multiple languages regularly,
            people who begin language study only in their adult lives can still
            reach the same level of fluency as a young learner and still reap
            the same mental benefits.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Learning a foreign language sharpens your
            cognitive abilities</p>
          <p>Learning Mandarin, for instance, takes your mind through entirely
            new experiences which enhance your memory, sharpen your cognitive
            abilities, improve your decision-making skills and increase your
            attention span. It is the perfect brain exercise. Below are some of
            the brain benefits of learning a foreign language.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Speaking Mandarin Uses More of Your Brain
            Power</p>
          <p>Learners of Mandarin are often stumped by the different tones in
            speaking Mandarin. It is indeed one of the greatest difficulties in
            learning Mandarin. However, it is precisely this difficulty that
            exercises more of your brain.</p>
          <p>According to a study published in the Proceedings for the National
            Academy of Sciences and conducted by researchers from Peking
            University, learning a tonal language such as Mandarin utilizes both
            left and right hemispheres of the brain whereas non-tonal language
            such as English uses just the left hemisphere.</p>
          <p>Researchers analysed brain imaging scans of both Mandarin and
            English speakers listening to their native languages. That the
            language centre of the brain, located in the left hemisphere, would
            light up was expected. However, for Chinese speakers, their right
            temporal lobe of the brain, specifically the region responsible for
            processing music, pitch and tones, also lit up. Chinese speakers use
            intonation to distinguish different meaning of particular words.
            This forces them to use both temporal lobes of their brain to
            understand the language.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Writing Chinese Keep the Mind Sharp</p>
          <p>The practice of handwriting is a good cognitive exercise that aids
            the development of motor skills, improve idea composition and
            expression. The writing of Chinese characters in particular, which
            involves sequential movement in writing strokes in all four
            directions (left, right, up and down) to form complex characters,
            activates neural activity in the working, thinking and spatial
            memory in the brain of learners.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Learning Chinese May Improve Your
            Mathematical Concept</p>
          <p>In addition, studies have shown that “there are differences in the
            brain representation of number processing between Chinese and
            English speakers”. Native English speakers largely employ a language
            process that relies on the left perisylvian cortices for mental
            calculation such as a simple addition task, whereas native Chinese
            speakers instead, engage a visuo-premotor association network for
            the same task. This could be related to the experience of reading
            Chinese characters, which are composed of high, nonlinear visual
            complexity. Chinese learners learn the various strokes and subunits
            of Chinese characters as well as linking their orthographic,
            phonological and semantic content. This complexity involves skills
            such as counting, identifying similarities and differences and
            grouping. This coupled with the specific linguistic expressions,
            Chinese speaking children may have gained a greater understanding of
            mathematical concepts than English speaking children.</p>
          <p>As one who speaks both English and Mandarin, I find the expression
            of fractions as a good example. In English, the fraction ¾ is
            expressed as “three-quarters”. To better understand the concept of
            “three-quarters”, one needs to know first what is a quarter. In
            comparison, in Chinese, ¾ is expressed as 四分之三 (sì fēn zhī sān), or
            “three of four parts”, which helps the speaker grasp the concept of
            the fraction more accurately and quickly.</p>
          <p>The expression of numbers is another example. In expressing numbers
            more than 10, the Chinese expression explains the mathematical
            concept. For example, in saying the number 11, a Chinese speaker
            would say, 十一 (shí yī), literally “ten one” (ten plus one). In
            saying 21, it is 二十一 (èr shí yī), literally “two ten one” (two times
            of ten plus one).</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Improves Your Decision-Making Skills</p>
          <p>Studies from the University of Chicago indicate that people who
            speak more than one language are better able to make more analytical
            decisions when they think through in non-native language. Thus they
            can avoid ‘loss aversion’, that is being too caught up in the ‘here
            and now’ to make choices that could profit us in future. Hence,
            multilingual people have better decision-making skills when it comes
            to finances.</p>
          <p>A possible reason is that a foreign language has less emotional
            resonance than one’s native language, since we learn the former in
            classrooms and formal institutions and the latter from family,
            friends and TV. “People who routinely make decisions in a foreign
            language might be less biased in their savings, investment and
            retirement decisions, as they show less myopic loss aversion. Over a
            long time horizon, this might very well be beneficial,” (Using a
            Foreign Language Helps Decision-Making)</p>
          <p>Also, speakers of a foreign language can pick up non-verbal
            communication better in a given situation. This enhances their
            appreciation of the different intricacies of a situation thus are
            more rational in decision making. On the other hand, monolingual
            individuals rely more on what is verbal and are less in touch with
            the nuances and subtleties of a conversation.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Improves Your Memory</p>
          <p>Research studies have shown that bilinguals perform better in
            auditory attention tests than monolinguals although early bilinguals
            might perform better than late bilinguals.</p>
          <p>The cognitive advantages of bilingualism in older adults can lead
            to slower cognitive aging and the onset of dementia. A lecturer at
            Edinburgh’s School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences,
            conducted a research with Dr. Suvarna Alladi of Nizam’s Institute of
            Medical Sciences in Hyderabad, India, and found that people in India
            who are bi- or multi-lingual from a young age, on average develop
            dementia about four years later than monolinguals. One possible
            reason could be that the brain is trained to be more attuned to
            auditory information in the process of learning two languages and
            switching back and forth. This improvement in auditory attention is
            a measure of concentration and could enable a bilingual to better
            extract relevant information from a lecture. Bak noted that many
            drugs aimed at lessening the effects of Alzheimer’s disease work by
            attempting to improve this attention mechanism.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Increases Your Attention Span</p>
          <p>A multilingual person often needs to switch between languages and
            decides on the appropriateness of using a particular language in a
            specific situation. This switching, evaluating and applying gives
            your brain plenty of exercise in focusing, and sifting through
            information. Thus the brain gets better at concentrating amidst
            distractions. North Western University’s professor Viorica Marian
            unearthed this benefit in a study published by the journal Brain and
            Language. She defines this ability as inhibitory control and
            describes it as a significant quality which is paramount “whether
            you are driving or performing surgery”.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Improves Your Communication in High
            Context Culture</p>
          <p>First used by anthropologist Edward Hall, the expressions "high
            context" and "low context" are labels denoting inherent cultural
            differences between societies. High-context and low-context
            communication refers to how much speakers rely on implicit
            communication and non-verbal cues other than words to convey
            meaning.</p>
          <p>In high-context communication, a message cannot be understood
            without a great deal of background information. Asian, African,
            Arab, central European and Latin American cultures are generally
            considered to be high-context cultures. High-context cultures often
            display the following tendencies, according to C.B. Halverson’s book
            <i>Cultural Context Inventory</i>.</p>
          <p> <b>• Association:</b> Relationships build slowly and depend on
            trust. Productivity depends on relationships and the group process.
            An individual’s identity is rooted in groups (family, culture,
            work). Social structure and authority are centralized.<br>
            <b>• Interaction:</b> Nonverbal elements such as voice tone,
            gestures, facial expression and eye movement are significant. Verbal
            messages are indirect, and communication is seen as an art form or
            way of engaging someone. Disagreement is personalized, and a person
            is sensitive to conflict expressed in someone else’s nonverbal
            communication.<br>
            <b>• Territoriality:</b> Space is communal. People stand close to
            each other and share the same space.<br>
            <b>• Temporality:</b> Everything has its own time, and time is not
            easily scheduled. Change is slow, and time is a process that belongs
            to others and nature.<br>
            <b>• Learning:</b> Multiple sources of information are used.
            Thinking proceeds from general to specific. Learning occurs by
            observing others as they model or demonstrate and then practicing.
            Groups are preferred, and accuracy is valued. </p>
          <p>A low-context culture relies on explicit communication. In
            low-context communication, more of the information in a message is
            spelled out and defined. Cultures with western European roots, such
            as the United States and Australia, are generally considered to be
            low-context cultures.</p>
          <p>Low-context cultures often display the following tendencies,
            according to Halverson.</p>
          <p> <b>• Association:</b> Relationships begin and end quickly.
            Productivity depends on procedures and paying attention to the goal.
            The identity of individuals is rooted in themselves and their
            accomplishments. Social structure is decentralized.<br>
            <b>• Interaction:</b> Nonverbal elements are not significant. Verbal
            messages are explicit, and communication is seen as a way of
            exchanging information, ideas and opinions. Disagreement is
            depersonalized; the focus is on rational (not personal) solutions.
            An individual can be explicit about another person’s bothersome
            behavior.<br>
            <b>• Territoriality:</b> Space is compartmentalized. Privacy is
            important, so people stand farther apart.<br>
            <b>• Temporality:</b> Events and tasks are scheduled and to be done
            at particular times. Change is fast, and time is a commodity to be
            spent or saved. One’s time is one’s own.<br>
            <b>• Learning:</b> One source of information is used. Thinking
            proceeds from specific to general. Learning occurs by following the
            explicit directions and explanations of others. Individual
            orientation is preferred, and speed is valued. </p>
          <p>In general, cultures that favour low-context communication will pay
            more attention to the literal meanings of words than to the context
            surrounding them.</p>
          <p>It is important to remember that every individual uses both
            high-context and low context communication.Often, the types of
            relationships we have with others and our circumstances will dictate
            the extent to which we rely more on literal or implied meanings. For
            example, a speaker from low-context culture will tend to use
            high-context communication if he/she is with family members.</p>
          <p>In learning the language and culture of a high-context language
            such as Chinese, one will gain more awareness of communication needs
            of high-context speakers by reading body language and understanding
            socially acceptable norms and cultures.</p>
