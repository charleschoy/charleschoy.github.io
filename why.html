        <div class="article" align="justify">
          <p>So you’ve decided that you want to move to Asia to study the
            Chinese language and while researching the best cities and schools,
            Google throws a gazillion results back at you, all based in China or
            Taiwan. However, did you know that Chinese (Mandarin) is also an
            official language of cosmopolitan, multi-lingual Singapore?
            Historically overshadowed in the field of Chinese language education
            by the traditional Chinese speaking areas, Singapore has been slowly
            establishing itself as a major player in the increasingly
            competitive field of Chinese language education. Here are 9 reasons
            why Singapore is an ideal place to begin your Chinese language
            studies!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 1: High level of safety and
            security</p>
          <p>One of the biggest concerns for foreigners moving to a new country
            is crime and how to avoid becoming a victim. Unlike the other
            Chinese-speaking countries, there are absolutely no dangerous
            neighborhoods to avoid in Singapore! Ranked the safest Asian country
            in 2017 by the World Justice Project, ahead of even Japan, Singapore
            is so safe that you can walk into a dimly lit back alley (although
            you would be hard-pressed to find one) drunk without having to worry
            the slightest bit about getting mugged!</p>
          <p>With no need to worry about crime, whether you intend to party
            every night, chat up locals to practice your Mandarin, or explore
            the local neighborhoods, you can put in a hundred percent effort
            without having to worry about personal safety.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 2: Chinese Language Proficiency of
            the Population</p>
          <p>Singaporean Chinese make up approximately 70% of the population and
            of these, and as of 2015, 46% speak Mandarin as a native language,
            with the remaining 54% learning Chinese as a second language as part
            of the public school curriculum starting from 7 years of age. While
            the number of Mandarin native speakers might seem low compared to
            the China and Taiwan, these figures actually present the Chinese
            language learner with an amazing opportunity!</p>
          <p>On the one hand, almost half the Chinese population are Mandarin
            native speakers who can supply you with natural expressions, idioms
            and vocabulary commonly used in the Sinosphere. On the other hand,
            those who learn Mandarin as a second language are more likely to
            speak more slowly and be able to help you find Mandarin equivalents
            for your English thoughts, as they have gone through the language
            learning process themselves.</p>
          <p>For those who have a strong preference for the Standard Putonghua
            accent of China, you would be glad to know that Singapore’s economic
            strength has recently attracted a large wave of Chinese migrants
            from China and Taiwan, both permanent and temporary, who work in all
            sectors of Singaporean society, and who are usually more than happy
            to help non-Chinese speakers with their language!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 3: Cultural Diversity</p>
          <p>In many parts of Asia, especially China, if you look the slightest
            bit non-local, you will get besieged by curious locals trying to
            sell you something or take photos with you. Even the least
            aggressive locals may stare and whisper at you for uncomfortably
            long periods of time. For those of us without nerves of steel that
            prefer to blend in with the crowd, racially diverse and cosmopolitan
            Singapore might be the ideal learning destination.</p>
          <p>Whether you rent an apartment downtown or out in the suburbs,
            Singaporeans are so used to seeing unfamiliar faces that your
            foreign face will most probably blend in perfectly with the locals.
            If you want a comfortable environment for practicing Mandarin
            without feeling like an exhibit on display, you would feel like a
            normal person in Singapore!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 4: Patience with errors</p>
          <p>Relating to the above two points, native speakers of Mandarin are
            usually overjoyed that a non-Chinese speaker has shown interest in
            their “difficult” language and will willingly lend a hand when
            asked. You might even hear, “Your Mandarin is really good!”, even if
            all you can do is stutter, “Ni Hao Ma?”.</p>
          <p>Non-native speakers will probably be less flattering with their
            appraisals of your Chinese level, but given the friendly nature of
            Singaporeans, they will still support you when they can, so don’t be
            shy about striking up a conversation in Mandarin with a local
            Chinese!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 5: There’s so much going on!</p>
          <p>As one of the major entertainment hubs of Southeast Asia, Singapore
            has a wealth of events taking place at any given time. A quick
            search on Meetup.com, Eventbrite or the National Library Board’s
            event page will easily turn up more than a twenty events happening
            on any given day! Whether you are looking for language exchanges to
            practice your languages, programming groups to further your craft,
            education workshops to learn something new, social events to make
            new friends, or an art exhibition to spark the creative soul in you,
            there is bound to be something happening everyday that will suit
            your interest!</p>
          <p>If nothing strikes your fancy, there are still many tourist sites
            for you to explore in between your language studies! Mainstream
            sites include the award-winning National Zoo, Clarke Quay, and many
            other hot spots, which can be found on the Singapore Tourism Board
            website. If you are feeling more adventurous and want to head off
            the beaten track, talk to your Singaporean friends into going ghost
            hunting with you at Bukit Brown Cemetery before the land gets
            completely redeveloped by the government in the next few years, or
            stop by Lorong Buangkok, the last functioning village in Singapore,
            to have a look at how Singaporeans used to live in the 1960s.</p>
          <p>There will be many events happening in between your classes, so
            take part in them and get a dose of local culture together with your
            Chinese language studies!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 6: A different culture is a hop, a
            jump and a skip away</p>
          <p>With a favorable location right smack in the middle of Southeast
            Asia, Singapore enjoys excellent connections to major cities around
            the region. Fancy having enjoying a full-body massage and high tea
            in Malaysia or Indonesia, where prices are almost 3 times cheaper
            than Singapore? You can easily hop across the causeway to Johor
            Bahru by bus in less than an hour, no matter where you are on the
            island. If you fancy something further afield, both Kuala Lumpur,
            Malaysia and Batam, Indonesia, are around an hour away by plane and
            ferry respectively! You can even get back in time for dinner if you
            leave in the morning!</p>
          <p>Of course, the developing economies of Southeast Asia offer more
            than just cheap shopping, with histories and cultural practices
            spanning thousands of years! With direct flights that get you to all
            the major cities in the region in less than 3 hours, you can easily
            plan your weekends around exploring a different culture each time!
            Go rock climbing in Krabi, Thailand one weekend and explore the
            highland aboriginal culture of Vietnam the next! If you want to keep
            your travels language-focused, the Malaysian Chinese living on the
            West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia are also well-known for their
            linguistic prowess!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 7: Strict rules and checks on
            private education providers</p>
          <p>All privately operated educational institutions are required by law
            to be registered with the Committee for Private Education (CPE), a
            government agency under the Ministry of Education of Singapore, with
            the aim of increasing the standard of education provided by these
            institutions, and protecting the interests of enrolled students.</p>
          <p>As long as an educational institution has a CPE logo with a
            registration number, you can rest assured that your school will not
            disappear overnight, along with your tuition fees!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 8: Great transportation
            infrastructure</p>
          <p>Singapore is well-connected by the public transportation system,
            which operates regular buses and trains from around 6 a.m to 11.30
            p.m, serving every possible point of interest on the island. If you
            are out late, night buses run between major neighbourhoods and can
            get you home for cheap, although routes are invariably circuitous.</p>
          <p>In addition, due to the unpredictable tropical weather, many
            pathways between major buildings, bus stops and subway stations are
            sheltered, which are great for helping you stay dry and happy during
            your daily commute to school!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 9: Go from basic Chinese to
            teaching Chinese</p>
          <p>There are many Chinese language schools around in Singapore with a
            curriculum that will take you from a complete beginner to a fairly
            advanced speaker. However, what if you want to take your studies
            even further and actually teach Chinese in your home country? Most
            people would automatically assume that you would have to further
            your studies in China or Taiwan, but did you know that Nanyang
            Technological University, one of the top 50 universities in the
            world, has prestigious degree programs specially for aspiring
            Chinese as a Second Language teachers?</p>
          <p>For those who can only commit for a shorter period of time, both
            the Confucius Institute and the National Institute of Education
            provide diploma programs in teaching Chinese as well!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">An Emerging Chinese Education Destination</p>
          <p>If you are looking to study the Chinese language in a cosmopolitan,
            multi-cultural city, consider starting your studies in Singapore!
            Your classroom time will be well-spent using Chinese to discuss not
            only Chinese culture, but also the diverse, rich and fascinating
            cultures of Southeast Asia as well!</p>
