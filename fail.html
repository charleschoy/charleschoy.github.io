          <p>Chances are, if you are a business leader or aspiring diplomat, you
            have already heard about how Mandarin Chinese is the next IT
            language to master in order to stand out in your field. After all,
            that was exactly what Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, did to set the
            Internet ablaze when he fielded questions at a conference at China’s
            Tsinghua University in Mandarin.</p>
          <p>Long before Zuckerberg made the headlines for his Mandarin
            abilities (and gained widespread support among the 1.3
            billion-strong Chinese population), former Prime Minister of
            Australia, Keven Rudd, was using his fluent Mandarin languages
            skills to do the exact same thing, impressing the Chinese public,
            building trust with the Chinese government and securing cooperation
            between Australia and China.</p>
          <p>Not all of us might want to run for office and build relationships
            on a global level, but whether you run your own business or work for
            a multi-national company, you are probably already aware of the
            benefits learning Mandarin Chinese would bring to your career. Not
            only do you get access to a huge market of 1.3 billion people that
            your competitors are not yet prepared to enter, this market also
            happens to be incredibly IT-savvy and quick to adopt new
            technologies, ideas and products.</p>
          <p>Convinced to start your Mandarin language learning journey yet?
            Here are the top five reasons why would-be Mandarin speakers fail or
            give up. As the old Chinese adage goes, 知己知彼，百戰百勝(zhī jǐ zhī bǐ ，
            bǎi zhàn bǎi shèng). As long as you understand yourself (along with
            your weaknesses and what makes you lose motivation), and your
            opponent (the scary-looking Mandarin Chinese language), you are
            guranteed victory at every turn.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 1: You never start</p>
          <p>Chinese is ranked as a Category 4 (reserved for the most difficult
            languages) language by the U.S Defense Language Institute, requiring
            a grand total of 1100 class hours to get to what they term as
            General Professional Proficiency in speaking and reading. To add
            fuel to fire, there are many websites and forums which attempt to
            “warn” the prospective learner of how difficult Chinese, or how
            impossible it is to master. The prospective learner listens to this
            “advice” and is scared off, never even attempting to pick up a
            Chinese textbook and giving up all the opportunities that comes with
            China’s rapidly growing economy.</p>
          <p>What to do: Ignore the naysayers and give the language a shot! What
            is difficult for others may be easy for you! Chinese vocabulary is
            both logical and highly visual in nature, akin to stacking Lego
            blocks together to form complex constructs. Take for example a
            concept like lactose intolerance, a fairly advanced word for English
            learners to grasp, can be analyzed and broken down into the
            following common Chinese characters.</p>
          <p>乳 - milk<br>
            糖 - sugar<br>
            不 - not<br>
            耐 - endure<br>
            症 - disease</p>
          <p>While the initial learning of the most fundamental words can be
            more time-consuming, the synergistic nature of Chinese vocabulary
            allows you to expand your vocabulary exponentially with almost every
            word you learn.</p>
          <p>The pictorial nature of the Chinese writing system is also
            inherently mnemonic, with each Chinese character telling a story of
            how it came to be. For example, 名, which means name, consists of:<br>
            1) 夕, which is a dark moonless night, and<br>
            2) 口, which means mouth.<br>
            The story goes that on a dark, moonless night, when you can’t
            clearly see who is coming towards you, you would open your mouth and
            ask for their name to ascertain whether they were friend of foe.</p>
          <p>With a knowledgable teacher to guide you through the logical
            development of each character, learning the basics of Chinese
            writing is a snap!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 2: Seeking Perfection from the
            Start</p>
          <p>The overwhelming reason why many enthusiastic first-time language
            learners give up is because they aim too high without fully
            understanding what they are in for. The aim of many learners is to
            speak flawlessly, with perfect grammar, vocabulary and
            pronunciation, and many language learning novices overextend
            themselves by requiring that every sentence they utter be perfect in
            those three aspects. When they realise they are not able to hold
            onto their dream for perfection, it is not long before they give up.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there are learners who are too afraid to utter a
            word in Mandarin, for fear of making an error and looking foolish.
            While the underlying motivation for perfection might be different
            from the above group, the result is the same, and over time, the
            inability to connect with Mandarin Chinese speakers causes them to
            lose motivation.</p>
          <p>What to do: The crux upon which language learning is based, is that
            as a language learner, you must fail fast and fail often. Get used
            to making mistakes and learning from them, as it is the quickest and
            surest way to reach the level of Mandarin Chinese you desire. A
            well-trained language teacher also serves as a coach and will be
            able to help you set SMART goals, with which you can measure your
            level of progress.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 3: Paralysis by Analysis</p>
          <p>With so many Chinese language learning resources out on the
            Internet, it’s easy to get overwhelmed when deciding which learning
            material is best. You might even spend more time analyzing the
            learning resources and combing the web for reviews and
            recommendations than actually studying the materials! All too often,
            you might start following a learning program only to realize that it
            does not meet your needs halfway in, and you have to do the
            selection process once again.</p>
          <p>What to do: When you are studying on your own, these setbacks can’t
            be helped and the best way to save time analyzing Chinese language
            learning materials is to get a trusted language buddy to select one
            for you. Of course, if you are studying Mandarin Chinese with a
            professional teacher, this is no longer a stumbling block and you
            skip over the materials selection process and jump straight into
            actually learning the language!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 4: Lack of Quality Guidance</p>
          <p>Whether you are learning Mandarin Chinese on your own or in class,
            you will need access to a native speaker who knows what they are
            doing. Many casual language exchange partner don’t have professional
            teaching experience and might not be able to skillfully create a
            situation for you to practice the words you have studied. Even
            worse, many professional Chinese teachers do not have international
            experience and follow the old-school lecture-style teaching format
            that is still prevalent in China and Taiwan, with teachers speaking
            90% of the time.</p>
          <p>What to do: For language exchanges, it is mostly a case of trial
            and error and after many tries, you might be able to build a stable
            of great language partners. If you are planning to enroll in a
            Mandarin class. it is rare to find Chinese teachers who will let
            students speak and interact with each other freely in class, so
            picking the right school is paramount in ensuring that you receive
            quality guidance! At Anytime Mandarin, teachers are trained in the
            communicative method and have international experience, which can be
            seen in their delivery of student-centered lessons.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">Reason 5: Lack of Constant Practice</p>
          <p>You have a busy life and it has been challenging to set aside some
            time every week to study and review the language you are so
            passionate about learning. Somehow you manage to squeeze out the
            time, studying for ten minutes on one day, thirty minutes a few days
            later, and fifteen minutes the next week. However, one day,
            something major happens in your life that you have to drop
            everything and focus on the disruption. When you finally have the
            time to get back to your Chinese language studies, you realize, to
            your despair, that you have already forgotten almost everything that
            you had learned and have to start all over!</p>
          <p>For those taking a Chinese language course with a school, missing a
            lesson might mean being completely lost for the rest of the course.
            Rarely do language schools offer make-up lessons covering the exact
            same lesson that you have missed, and fewer still will do it for no
            extra charge.</p>
          <p>What to do: Unfortunately, with language learning, consistency is
            the best policy and will give you a sense of accomplishment as you
            plough ahead.</p>
          <p>For those who want to study Mandarin Chinese with a professional
            teacher at a language school, Anytime Chinese pioneers a unique
            curriculum concept, where each class is a standalone lesson and
            students are free to take classes at their level on any day of the
            week, or redo a class that they have taken.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 30px;">How to Succeed in Learning Mandarin</p>
          <p>To be able to speak Mandarin like Kevin Rudd, you need to
            consistently practice your Chinese language skills over an extended
            period of time without giving up, be open to making frequent
            mistakes and learning from them, find a quality guide to help you
            correct your errors, and select interesting learning materials that
            are beneficial in your learning.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, you have to start learning your first word! After
            all, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Your
            Mandarin learning journey awaits!</p>
